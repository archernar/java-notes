  <title>Java: Packages - Importing</title>

<h1 class="title"><a href="../../index.html">Java Notes</a></h1><h1>Packages - Importing</h1>


<p><b>Packages = directories.</b>
Multiple classes of larger programs are grouped 
together into a <i>package</i>.  Packages correspond to
directories in the file system, and may be nested just
as directories are nested.  Small, single-class, programs
typically do not use packages, but a
</p>

<h2>Importing all classes from a package using *</h2>
<p>Java libraries are organized in packages (directories).
The most common way to get access to them is to use the
<code>import</code> statement.
For example,</p>
<pre class="fragment"><span class="hiliteu">import java.util.*;</span>
. . .
ArrayList&lt;String&gt; studentNames;  // ArrayList is a class in java.util</pre>

<p>
gives your program access to the all (that's what the "*" means)
classes in the package <code>java.util</code>.
The source files for these classes are in a directory named
<code>util</code>, which is in a directory named <code>java</code>.
</p>

<h2>Importing each class explicitly</h2>
<p>
If you need only one class from a package, eg <code>ArrayList</code>, you can write
</p>
<pre class="fragment">import java.util.<span class="hiliteu">ArrayList</span>;
. . .
ArrayList&lt;String&gt; studentNames;  // same as above.</pre>


<p>You might think that importing all classes from a package is inefficient,
but there is no noticeable difference in my experience.  
Consequently most programs use the ".*" style of import. 
</p>


<h2>Using package qualifiers instead of imports</h2>
<p>The <code>import</code> statement is not required. 
Class references can be made but explicit qualification with the "."
operator.  For example,
</p>
<pre class="fragment"><span class="hiliteu">java.util.ArrayList</span>&lt;String&gt; studentNames; // fully qualified.  No need for import.</pre>

<p>The fully qualified style is used in some textbooks, 
but is generally not used when programming, where the 
import style is almost universal. 
</p>
<p>
However, there is one situation where qualification is 
<i>necessary</i> - when two classes have the same name,
but are in different packages.  For example, there is both
<code>java.util.Timer</code> and <code>java.swing.Timer</code>.
Because it's common to import all classes in both <code>java.util</code>
and <code>javax.swing</code>, the name <code>Timer</code> is ambiguous and 
can't be used without qualification.  
</p>
<pre class="fragment">import java.util.*;    // The java.util package contains a Timer class.
import javax.swing.*;  // The javax.swing package also contains a Timer class.
. . .
<s>Timer t;</s>            // AMBIGUOUS - compilation error
java.util.Timer t;  // OK, you've told the compiler which one you want.</pre>



<h2>Packages within packages require additional imports</h2>
<p>The import statement gives access to classes in a package, 
but not to packages in that package.  For example, 
</p>

<pre class="fragment">import java.util.*;</pre>

<p>does not give access to the classes of the package <code>java.util.regex</code>.
To access classes in <code>java.util</code> and
<code>java.util.regex</code>, import both.
</p>

<pre class="fragment">import java.util.*;
import java.util.regex.*;</pre>
   
   

<h2>Java's <code>import</code> is not the same as C++'s <code>#include</code></h2>
<p>C++'s <code>#include</code> is commonly used to for library headers,
but the mechanism which is used is fundamentally different.  
<code>#include</code> inserts the entire <i>source file</i> that is referenced into
your C++ program.
In contrast, the Java <code>import</code> statement only looks up the 
the identifiers and their declarations from the <i>compiled class file</i> (not the 
source files).
</p>

<p>Another difference is that Java imports are <i>non-transitive</i>.  
If class A imports <code>packagex</code> and <code>packagex</code>
imports <code>packagey</code>, class A does NOT get access to <code>packagey</code>.
In C++, the imports are transitive, which can lead to some unexpected effects.
</p>

<p>A minor difference is that Java's <code>import</code> is a statement and
requires a semicolon, unlike C++.

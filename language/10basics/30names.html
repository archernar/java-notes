  <title>Java: Identifier Names</title>
</head>
<body><div id="content">

<h1 class="title"><a href="../../index.html">Java Notes</a></h1><h1>Identifier Names</h1>

<p>Getting the names of things right is extremely important.  It makes a huge
difference in readability.  Many IDEs support <i>refactoring</i>, and specifically
renaming.  I will sometimes rename classes several times before I hit on exactly
the obvious name.  It's worth the effort.
</p>


<h2>Legal Characters</h2>

<p>Every name is made from the following characters, starting with a letter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Letters: a-z, A-Z, and other alphabetic characters from other languages.</li>
<li>Digits: 0-9</li>
<li>Special: _ (underscore).  A single underscore is a reserved keyword as of Java 9.</li>
</ul>

<p>No names can be the same as
a Java keyword (eg, <tt>import</tt>, <tt>if</tt>, ...).
</p>
   

<h2>Examples</h2>

<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0">
<tr><td><code>apple</code></td>                     <td>This is a legal name.  Lowercase implies it's a variable or method.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>Apple</code></td>                     <td>This is a different legal name.  Uppercase implies it's a class or interface.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>APPLE</code></td>                     <td>Yet a different legal name.  All uppercase implies it's a constant.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>topleft</code></td>                   <td>Legal, but multiple words should be camelcase.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>top_left</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Better, but camelcase is preferred to _ in Java.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>topLeft</code></td>                   <td>Good Java style</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>top left</code></td>                  <td>ILLEGAL - no blanks in a name</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>import</code></td>                    <td>ILLEGAL - same as the Java keyword</td></tr>
</table>


<h2>Using Uppercase, Lowercase, and "Camelcase" Letters</h2>
<p>The conventions for the use of upper- and lowercase is not enforced by compilers,
but it is so widely observed, that it should have been.
<i>Camelcase</i> is the practice of capitalizing the first letter of 
successive words in multi-word identifiers.  Camelcase is much preferred
in the Java community over the use of underscores to separate words, or
even worse, no distinction made at word boundaries.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Class and interface names - Start with uppercase</dt>
  <dd>Class and interface names start with an uppercase letter,
    and continue in lowercase.  For multiple words, use <i>camelcase</i>.
    Eg, Direction, LogicalLayout, DebugGapSpacer.
    </dd>
<dt>Variable and method names - Lowercase</dt>
    <dd>
    Lowercase is used for variable and method names.
    If a name has multiple words, use camelcase.
    Eg, top, width, topLeft, roomWidth, incomeAfterTaxes.
    </dd>
<dt>Constants - All uppercase, use _ to separate words</dt>
    <dd>The names of constants (typically declared <i>static final</i>) should
    be in all uppercase.  For example, <tt>BorderLayout.NORTH</tt>.
    When constant names are made from multiple words, use an underscore
    to separate words, eg, <code>JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE</code>
    </dd>
</dl>


<h2>Readable names are more important than most comments</h2>
<p>Java doesn't care if your names are readable, but it's really 
important to make your names readable to humans.
</p>
<p>I once worked on a project where we had to distribute the source code
so that it could be compiled on another machine, but we didn't want to 
reveal our algorithms.  We deleted all comments and indentation, and wrote a small program to change
all variable names to combinations of "I", "1", "O", and "0", figuring that it would be
too much effort for them to decode it.  For example, the semi-readable
</p>
<pre>
LogicalGapInfo topBorder = m_logicalLayout.getGapInfo(LogicalLayout.AXIS_V, 0);</pre>
<p>Could be translated into</p>
<pre>
I001O I00I0 = O1001.OI001(O1OOI.IO010, 0);</pre>

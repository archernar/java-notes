  <title>Java: Packages - Defining</title>
</head>
<body><div id="content">

<h1 class="title"><a href="../../index.html">Java Notes</a></h1><h1>Packages - Defining</h1>

<p><b>Package = directory</b>.  Multiple classes of larger programs are usually grouped 
together into a <i>package</i>.  Packages correspond to
directories in the file system, and may be nested just
as directories are nested.
</p>

<h2>Reasons to use packages</h2>
<ul>
<li>Grouping related classes.</li>
<li>In large programs prevents name conflicts.</li>
<li>Allows effective use of default "package" visibility.</li>
<li>Creates a unique class name for distribution, Preferences, ...</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Grouping related classes.</b>
If you are writing a normal one-programmer application, it will typically be in one package.  
The purpose of a package is to group all related classes together.
If you are working on a program that is divided into separate
sections that are worked on by others, each section might be
in its own package.  This prevents class name conflicts and reduces coupling by 
allowing package scope to be used effectively.
</p>
<p><b>Library in package</b>.
If you're writing a library to use in various programming projects 
or by others, put it in its own package.  Programs that use this library 
will be developed in their own packages.
With its thousands of library classes, Java has grouped related library classes 
into packages, but usually you won't define more than one package.
</p>

<h3>Summary of how many packages you usually define</h3>
<ul>
<li>Normal programs = one package.</li>
<li>Library = one package.</li>
<li>Program + library = two packages.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Reasons for using packages</h2>
<ul>
<li>Limit the scope of class names.</li>
<li>To make package access more usable.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Package declarations</h2>
<p>Each file may have a <code>package</code> declaration which
precedes all non-comment code.  The package name
<i>must be the same</i> as the enclosing directory.
</p>
<p><b>Default package</b>.  If a package declaration is omitted, 
all classes in that directory are said to belong to the 
"default" package.
</p>
<p>
Here are two files in the <code>packagetest</code> directory.
</p>
<pre class="file">
<span class="hiliteu">package packagetest;</span>

class ClassA {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ClassB.greet();
    }
}</pre>
and
<pre class="file">
<span class="hiliteu">package packagetest;</span>  // Same as in previous file.

class ClassB {
    static void greet() {
        System.out.println("Hi");
    }
}</pre>

<p>Note that these source files must be named <code>ClassA.java</code>
and <code>ClassB.java</code> (case matters)
and they must be in a directory named <code>packagetest</code>.
</p>

<!--
<h2>Package scope</h2>
In the above example ClassA and ClassB were declared with default scope,
commonly known as <i>package</i> scope (as opposed to 
<code>public</code>, <code>private</code>, or <code>protected</code>.
[TO DO - more explanation] 
-->

   
<h2>Compiling and running packages from a command line</h2>
<p>To compile the above example, you must be <i>outside</i> the
<code>packagetest</code> directory.  
To compile the classes:
</p>
<pre>
   javac packagetest/ClassB.java
   javac packagetest/ClassA.java</pre>
To run the <code>main</code> program in <code>ClassA</code>.
<pre>
   java packagetest.ClassA</pre>
   or
<pre>
   java packagetest/ClassA</pre>
   
<p>In windows the "/" can be replaced by the "\" in the <code>javac</code>
command, but not in the <code>java</code> command.
Generally use a forward slash ("/") because it is used
more commonly than the backslash in other places as well.
</p>

<!-- 
If you've been developing small programs, you didn't have to worry about grouping all your files. A "package" corresponds to a directory, and they are sometimes nested for a large number of files, like the Java library. If you look at the Java library source code, you'll find a directory called "java". In that directory, you'll find a "util" directory (the java.util package) which contains all the classes in this package (Scanner, ArrayList, etc), an "awt" directory (java.awt package), etc.

The other reason to define packages is to make your fully qualified class names completely unique. Java recommends using a reversed domain name. I own the domain name fredswartz.com, so I often use the package name com.fredswartz, at least for any programs that I'm moderately serious about.

Sun recommends strongly that you use packages for your programs -- I believe this is because it's difficult to do some things if they aren't in a package, or at least it's more convenient (eg, Preferences). Nothing you'd use for a small program, but it becomes important for larger programs.
